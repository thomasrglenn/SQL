#In this SQL project, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1 How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct c.acctnum
FROM customers AS c
INNER JOIN FebSales AS f
ON c.order_id = f.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
ORDER BY c.acctnum ASC;

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product, MIN(price) 
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT distinct Product, (SUM(quantity)*price) AS revenue
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY revenue DESC;

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the 
total revenue?
SELECT Product, quantity, (SUM(quantity)*price) AS revenue
FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those 
customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct c.acctnum) AS num_of_customers, AVG(quantity*price) AS avg_spent
FROM FebSales AS f
JOIN customers as c
ON f.orderID = c.order_id
WHERE f.quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity) AS total_sold
FROM FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY total_sold DESC;

#9 Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they
each receive? 
SELECT location, COUNT(orderID) as total_orders
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID) >= 3
AND location like '%NY%';

#10 How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT Product as headphone_type, 
SUM(quantity) as total_sold
FROM FebSales
WHERE Product like '%headphone%'
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY total_sold DESC;


#11 What was the average amount spent per account in February? 
SELECT SUM(f.quantity * f.price) / 
Count(c.acctnum) as avg_spent
FROM FebSales as f
JOIN customers as c
ON f.orderID = c.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';


#12 What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?
SELECT SUM(f.quantity) / COUNT(c.acctnum)
as avg_quantity
FROM FebSales as f
JOIN customers as c
ON f.orderID = c.order_id
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderiD <> 'Order ID';


#13 Which product brought in the most revenue in January, and how much revenue did it bring in?
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity * price) as total_revenue
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product
